                Notes:
                    1. The flags M2, M3, MC refer to the contents of data items I048/050, I048/070
                       and I048/090 respectively. The flag M1 refers to the contents of data item
                       I048/055, Mode 1 Code in Octal Representation, and to the contents of the
                       Subitem #5 (Extended Mode 1 Code in Octal Representation).
                    2. If an authenticated Mode 5 reply/report is received with the Emergency bit set,
                       then the Military Emergency bit (ME) in Data Item I048/020, Target Report
                       Descriptor, shall be set.
                    3. If an authenticated Mode 5 reply/report is received with the Identification of
                       Position bit set, then the Special Position Identification bit (SPI) in Data Item
                       I048/020, Target Report Descriptor, shall be set.

        **I048/MD5/PMN** - *PIN/ National Origin/Mission Code*

            remark
                Note:
                    Bit 14 (NAV) is set to 1 if the value for National Origin is not known or invalid.
                    Under certain conditions PIN is available but NAT is not available. NAV then
                    indicates that the NAT field was not actively populated.

            - value :math:`>= -180.0` °
            - value :math:`<= 180.0` °

            remark
                Notes:
                    Latitude in WGS 84 is expressed as a 24-bit two’s complement number.
                    Range -90° ≤ latitude ≤ 90°. Sign convention: North is positive.
                    LSB = 180/223 degrees = 2.145767*10-05 degrees.

                    Longitude in WGS 84 is expressed as a 24-bit two’s complement number.
                    Range -180° ≤ longitude < 180°. Sign convention: East is positive.
                    LSB = 180/223 degrees = 2.145767*10-05 degrees.

                    The resolution implied by the LSB is better than the resolution with which Mode 5
                    position reports are transmitted from aircraft transponders using currently defined
                    formats.

            **I048/MD5/EM1/(spare)**

            - 1 bit [``.``]

            **I048/MD5/EM1/EM1** - *Extended Mode 1 Code in Octal Representation*

            - 12 bits [``............``]

            - Octal string (3-bits per digit)

            remark
                Notes:
                    1. If Subitem #1 is present, the M1 bit in Subitem #1 indicates whether the
                       Extended Mode 1 Code is from a Mode 5 reply or a Mode 1 reply. If Subitem
                       #1 is not present, the Extended Mode 1 Code is from a Mode 1 reply.
                    2. For reasons of backwards compatibility the logic for the setting of the V-bit
                       was inverted compared to other similar data items.
                    3. The values of the bits for V, G, L, A4, A2, A1, B2 and B1 shall be identical to
                       the values of the corresponding bits in data item I048/055.

        **I048/MD5/TOS** - *Time Offset for POS and GA*

        - 8 bits [``........``]

        - LSB = :math:`1 / {2^{7}}` s = :math:`1 / {128}` s :math:`\approx 7.8125e-3` s

            remark
                Note:
                    TOS shall be assumed to be zero if Subitem #6 is not present.

        **I048/MD5/XP** - *X Pulse Presence*

            **I048/MD5/XP/(spare)**

                | 0: X-pulse set to zero or no authenticated Data reply or Report received
                | 1: X-pulse set to one (present)

            **I048/MD5/XP/XC** - *X-pulse from Mode C Reply*

            - 1 bit [``.``]

            - values:

                | 0: X-pulse set to zero or no Mode 1 reply
                | 1: X-pulse set to one (present)

            remark
                Note:
                    Within Mode 5 replies/reports, the X-Pulse can be set for the following cases:
                    1. In a combined Mode 1 and Mode 2 reply/report: in this case the X5 bit and the X2 bit
                       shall be set;
                    2. In a combined Mode 3 and Mode C reply/report: in this case the X5 bit and the X3 bit
                       shall be set;
                    3. In a Mode 5 PIN data reply/report: in this case the X5 bit and the XP bit shall be set.
                    The X1 bit and the XC bit are meaningless as in Mode 1 and Mode C replies/reports
                    the X Pulse is not defined. They are kept for compatibility reasons.

        remark
            Note:
                In 2011 NATO has modified the format of the National Origin information
                available in subitem 2 of the Mode 5 data item in this Reserved Expansion Field. The
                information for National Origin and Mission Code were combined into a 11-bit long
                field. In order to maintain backwards compatibility and to ease the use of the new
                layout, the original Mode 5 data item was copied and the layout of subitem #2
                adapted. The new layout is reflected in the data item M5N and shall be used by
                equipment prepared for the new National Origin system.
                Equipment certified to the previous encoding shall continue to use the data item MD5
                corresponding to the 5-bit National Origin / 6-bit Mission Code.

                    Bit 12 (NOV) is set to 1 if the value for National Origin is not known or invalid.
                    Under certain conditions PIN is available but NO is not available. NOV then
                    indicates that the NO field was not actively populated.

                    2. For reasons of backwards compatibility the logic for the setting of the V-bit
                       was inverted compared to other similar data items.

                    3. In a Mode 5 PIN data reply/report: in this case the X5 bit and the XP bit shall be set.
                    The X1 bit and the XC bit are meaningless as in Mode 1 and Mode C replies/reports
                    the X Pulse is not defined. They are kept for compatibility reasons.

                available in subitem 2 of the Mode 5 data item in this Reserved Expansion Field. The
                information for National Origin and Mission Code were combined into a 11-bit long
                field. In order to maintain backwards compatibility and to ease the use of the new
                layout, the original Mode 5 data item was copied and the layout of subitem #2
                adapted. The new layout is reflected in the data item M5N and shall be used by
                equipment prepared for the new National Origin system.

        remark
            Notes:
                1. For radars with an operational range beyond 256 NM data item I048/040 is
                   insufficient. These radars may use this extension to provide the target position
                   equal to or beyond 256 NM. In such cases, data item I048/040 shall be
                   transmitted in addition to this extension. In this case it is recommended to
                   set bits 32/17 in data item I048/040 to “1”.
                2. The Encoding Rule for data item I048/040 still applies.
                3. This item represents the measured target position of the plot, even if
                   associated with a track, for the present antenna scan. It is expressed in polar
                   co-ordinates in the local reference system, centred on the radar station.
                4. In case of combined detection by a PSR and an SSR, then the SSR position is
                   sent.
                5. Before migrating an ASTERIX encoder to Edition 1.10 of this specification,
                   care has to be taken that receiving decoders allow the presence of the value
                   256 NM in the record. Systems applying a range check may otherwise
                   suppress the record.

            remark
                Notes:
                    1. This item indicates a difference in the value for TCODEX between the code in
                       the track file and the code from the latest plot updating the track.
                    2. If TCOUNTX is set to 0 then TCODEX is meaningless and all bits shall be set
                       to 0.
                    3. The meaning of the individual bits in TCODEX is described in ICAO Annex 10
                       Volume 4 Chapter 3.1.1.6.2.

                       in the ICD of the system generating the ASTERIX record.
                    3. The TRKUPDCTR is initiated with a value of 1 and it is incremented by 1 each
                       time a track is updated.
                    4. The LASTTRKUPD is set to 0 each time a track is updated.
