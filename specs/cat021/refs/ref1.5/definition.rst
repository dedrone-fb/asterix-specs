        - 12 bits [``............``]

        - unsigned quantity
        - scaling factor: 0.1
        - fractional bits: 0
        - unit: "hPa"
        - LSB = :math:`0.1` hPa
        - value :math:`>= 0` hPa
        - value :math:`<= 409.5` hPa

        remark
            Notes:

                - BPS is the barometric pressure setting of the aircraft minus 800 hPa

                - A value of "0" indicates that in the aircraft a value of 800 hPa or
                  less has been selected.

                - A value of "409.5" indicates that in the aircraft a value of 1209.5
                  hPa or more has been selected.

        remark
            On many aircraft, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem receives
            Selected Heading from a Mode Control Panel / Flight Control Unit
            (MCP / FCU). Users of this data are cautioned that the Selected
            Heading value transmitted by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem
            does not necessarily reflect the true intention of the airplane during
            certain flight modes (e.g., during LNAV mode).

            remark
                Notes:
                    1. For ADS-B Version 3 systems as defined in EUROCAE ED-
                       102B/RTCA DO-260C (Ref. [11]) the values have been re-defined.
                       PS3 shall be used exclusively for Version 3 ADS-B systems as
                       defined in I021/210/VN.
                    2. For ADS-B systems with a version number below 3, the PS
                       shall be encoded in Data Item I021/200/PS.
                       However, since values have been re-defined in ADS-B Version 3,
                       mapping is required to ensure that information is not lost. This
                       mapping shall be done according to the following table: ::

                         ADS-B Version 3 (PS3)           ADS-Version < 3 (I021/200 - PS)
                         0 (No Emergency/not reported)   0 (No Emergency/not reported)
                         1 (General emergency)           1 (General emergency)
                         2 (UAS/RPAS Lost Link)          4 (No communication)
                         3 (Minimum fuel)                3 (Minimum fuel)
                         4 (No communication)            4 (No communication)
                         5 (Unlawful interference)       5 (Unlawful interference)
                         6 (Aircraft in distress -       1 (General emergency)
                           automatic activation)
                         7 (Aircraft in distress -       1 (General emergency)
                           manual activation)

                    3. TPW#VAL is defined in EUROCAE ED-102B/DO-260C Ref. [11]
                       “Aircraft Operational Status Message (Register 65 16 )” Bits 17-18
                       and indicates the nearest minimum transmit power (in Watts) at the
                       antenna port. The nearest minimum setting in this field would be
                       rounded down from the actual design value. For example, if the
                       avionics is designed to transmit at 100W out of the antenna port, the
                       encoded value in this field would be for 70W (decimal 1).
