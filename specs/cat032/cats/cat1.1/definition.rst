    1. The User numbers are predefined in the User registration data base
       of the SDPS Unit to which the User wants to connect.
    2. In case of message originating from an FPPS, the User Number
       corresponds to the FPPS one.
    3. In case of message originating from an SDPS, the User Number
       corresponds to the SDPS unit receiving the Miniplan.

I032/018 - Data Source Identification Tag

Notes:

    1. Each Track Number (i.e. either a Master or a Slave Track Number)
       is composed of a System Unit Identification (i.e. the identification
       of the SDPS unit processing the) together with the relevant System
       Track Number (i.e. the number of the track local to the SDPS Unit
       in question).
    2. The Composed Track Number is used by co-operating SDPS units to
       uniquely identify a track. It consists of the unit identifier and
       system track number for each unit involved in the co-operation.
       The first unit identification identifies the unit that is responsible
