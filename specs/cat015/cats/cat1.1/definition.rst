        | 1: Extension into next extent

Note 1: The MoMu bit is used to indicate whether the target report
was constructed from a multi-static (including bi-static) or
mono-static sensor. Its setting dictates the interpretation of data
items I015/625 and I015/626. The meaning of the value “other” shall
be described in the system ICD.

Note 2: In this context, a Reference Target Report stems from
a non-aircraft target based on RF received externally to the system
boundary. This may be generated, for example, by an external RF
generator or a Permanent Echo or from a device, which is deployed
in line of sight of the sensor.

Note 3: A synthetic target is an internally generated diagnostic
signal prior to the generation of the ASTERIX Category 015 target
report. For example used to support test processes.

Note 4: This value is used to represent externally generated
targets or recorded data injected into the output data stream
of the INCS system e.g. for test or training purposes.

Note 5: This indication is used to inform about the scanning
direction of the system (e.g. left/right, up/down,
clockwise/anti-clockwise). It’s exact meaning is implementation
dependent and shall be described in the system ICD.

I015/030 - Warning/Error Conditions
***********************************

*Definition*: Warning/error conditions detected by a system for the target report
involved.

Repetitive item with FX extension

    - 7 bits [``.......``]

    - raw value

Note 1: It has to be stressed that a series of one or more W/E
conditions can be reported per target report.

Note 2: The nature of the warning / error condition may differ
between sensor types and the declaration and use of such alerts
is driven by end user requirements.

Note 3: Potential applications could be to indicate that the target
report correlates with road infrastructure (terrestrial vehicles)
or a wind turbine or that it is a fixed or slow moving return or
originating from an area of high clutter. Such data items could
also be used to indicate the presence of interference – either
deliberate or accidental.

Note 4: The Warning/Error Condition Values from 1-31 are reserved
for designation by the ASTERIX Maintenance Group. System
implementers are free to use values of 32 and above. The allocation
of the remaining values of this data item shall be defined in a
local Interface Control Document.

Note 5: The value of “0” must not be assigned.

contained in data item I015/600, I015/601, I015/625, I015/626,
I015/627, I015/628 whichever is available. In case of a Track End
Message (Message Type = 5) it refers to the time at which the track
is terminated and the track number (data item I015/161) is released
for re-use.

Note 2: A distributed sensor, such as an MSPSR, may have multiple
elements that are each individually time stamped which are
consolidated in to a target report. Rather than provide details
of each time stamped message, this data item conveys the time
of applicability of position of the target report.

Note 3: The Time of Applicability value is reset to zero each day
at midnight.

Note 4: The Time of Applicability value shall be formatted as a
binary unsigned integer.

been interrupted and whose position/height is being predicted based
on the previously received responses.

Note 3: The blind zone or blanked zone are predictable zones where
no detection is predicted.
If bit 5 is set and TTS = 1 then the track is coasted because it is
in a blind zone or sector blank zone.

        **I015/300/PRB** - *Probability*

        - 7 bits [``.......``]

        - unsigned integer

Note 1: INCS processing may be able to provide an indication of the
nature of the target e.g. road vehicle or aircraft with the
potential for further discrimination in the type of the aircraft
e.g. two engine, fixed wing/helicopter etc.
Before including requirements for target classification it is
necessary to consider the operational manner in which such
information would be used and how/if such data would be made
available to the controllers.

Note 2: Target classification is attributing, with an acceptable
degree of confidence, a target report as having originated from
a specific object or target type e.g. fixed wing aircraft, flock
of birds etc. (It should be noted that the probabilities assigned
to a target do not necessarily need to add up to 100%)
The ability of an INCS sensor to classify the targets it detects
is dependent upon the systems capabilities and is driven by end
user requirements. The use of this optional data item is to be
agreed between parties such as the system manufacturer, the system
operator agency and the end user. The allocation of the CLS octet
is to be defined in a local Interface Control Document that shall
be agreed by both parties.

Note 3: If this functionality is implemented in the sensor, the
classification result (CLS), PRB and REP value shall be formatted
as a binary unsigned integer.

        remark
            Note: The velocity resolution describes the capability
            of a sensor to be able to separate two closely located
            targets in the velocity domain. The velocity resolution
            for an INCS system depends on the signal integration time
            as well as the transmit frequency. A longer integration
            time or a higher transmit frequency leads to a better
            velocity resolution. Depending on the specific INCS
            application, a better velocity resolution may be more
            important than a high sensor refresh rate. The velocity
            resolution might also alleviate the limitations on the
            range resolution, in order to make small bandwidth
            applications possible.

Note 1: Depending upon its design the manner in which the
positional data is declared by an INCS sensor may be expressed
in WGS-84 (I015/ 600) or sensor centric coordinate system based
upon the ‘system reference point’ of the sensor (I015/625).

Note 2: The optional ‘precision’ fields (in Data Items
I015/600 – I015/625) provide a measure of the accuracy the INCS
system has assigned to positional data contained in the target
report.
Such information can be used to improve the quality with which
the INCS target report data is integrated in to the subsequent
processing stages of the ATM infrastructure.
However a consideration of the sensor characteristics and
capabilities, the manner in which INCS data is used operationally,
the weighting assigned to INCS data within a multi-sensor tracker
and the credibility assigned to the covariance data items should
be made to support the decision of whether these optional
covariance data items are required or whether the basic data items
provide sufficient performance.
Whilst not an operational consideration the additional costs that
may be associated with the provision and use of such data items
should also be weighed against the potential performance benefits
that would be achieved through the inclusion of these Data Items
in performance specifications.

Note 3: If I015/020 MoMu indicates that the target report is
Bi-Static (MoMu =1) then the range information is the difference
between the path from the transmitter to target to the receiver
less the distance between the transmitter and receiver. In this
case, the reference points referred to above are the positions
of the transmitter and receiver.
If I015/020 MoMu indicates that the target report is Mono-Static
(MoMu =0) then the range information is the distance between
the sensor and the target. In this case, the reference point
referred to above is the position of the mono-static sensor.

Note 4: The meaning of range in Category 015 is significantly
broader than the traditional hence the different INCS working
principles. This is especially true for bi-static and multi-static
radars. For readability the field is still called range and not
mono-/bi-/multi-static range or pseudo-range.
For radar the measured range is calculated from time differences
of signals assumed to be transmitted/received at the sensor
reference point(s). As noted above for bi-static radars the
reference points are the positions of the transmitter and receiver.
Moreover multi-static radars may receive identical signals from
other transmitters than the assumed reference transmitter
(e.g. passive INCS which are using single frequency networks as
illuminators) and therefore may calculate negative values for
bi-static range measurement data.
